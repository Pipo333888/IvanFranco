## 🔍 What is a logistic growth model with multivariate responses?

A logistic growth model follows an S-shaped curve: it starts with rapid (exponential) growth, then slows as it approaches a maximum carrying capacity. When extended to multivariate responses, this model simultaneously predicts several related outcome variables—such as sales volume, market share, and distribution reach—capturing their interdependencies and shared growth dynamics. This approach provides a holistic view of how multiple metrics evolve under real-world constraints.

## 🔍 What is a dynamic time series forecasting model?

A dynamic time series forecasting model continuously updates its parameters or components as new data arrives, allowing it to adapt to changing trends, seasonality, and volatility. This real-time adjustment improves predictive accuracy in non-stationary processes.
